# Sprint 11 C1 Progress
Last updated: 2026-02-16

## Overall
- Status: done (implementation baseline complete)
- Current phase: wrap-up and verification
- Goal: Optional cloud sync with local-first fallback for prompt/skill/anatomy

## Completed
- [x] Added first-class `anatomy` library type support in local model
- [x] Added optional runtime auth provider (`RuntimeAuthProvider`) with Clerk integration
- [x] Added sync settings persistence (`prmpt.sync.v1.settings`)
- [x] Added cloud sync runtime registry and storage write-through mirror hooks
- [x] Added Convex client bridge for list/upsert/delete/toggle/touch + migration helper
- [x] Added app-level sync bootstrap/hydration behavior
- [x] Added Cloud Sync panel to Library Dashboard
- [x] Added Convex backend scaffolding (`convex/schema.ts`, `convex/libraryItems.ts`, `convex/auth.config.ts`)
- [x] Added `.env.example` placeholders for Clerk + Convex
- [x] Updated README with cloud sync setup and usage notes
- [x] Type-check passed
- [x] Playwright regression subset passed
- [x] Added `debrief.md` final summary

## Remaining / Next Sprint
- [ ] Add queue/retry policy for offline writes beyond basic error recording
- [ ] Add dedicated Clerk-authenticated sync e2e tests
- [ ] Add Convex server tests for auth isolation + LWW edge cases

## Risks / Notes
- Convex backend requires generated files at runtime (`bun run dev:backend`).
- Clerk/Convex env vars must be set in `.env.local`.
- Local-first behavior remains fallback when sync disabled or unavailable.
